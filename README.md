## Quick start

First, you need to have a [Docker and Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/) installed.
For OS X users I would also recommend to have a [docker-machine-nfs](https://github.com/adlogix/docker-machine-nfs/).

```bash
docker-compose up
```

That's all! You'll end up running with a fresh Drupal 8 installation at http://localhost:8000/.
The administrator login is **admin**, password is **password**.
